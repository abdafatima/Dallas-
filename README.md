# Dallas Police Case Suspension Analysis

This repository presents a machine learning analysis of police case suspensions using real incident data from Dallas, Texas. The goal is to identify the most influential factors behind the suspension of police investigations, particularly focusing on victim demographics, incident characteristics, and geographical variables.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Source:** Dallas Open Data (Police Reports)
- **Size:** 300,000+ incident records
- **Target Variable:** Case Suspension (Suspended = 1, Not Suspended = 0)
- **Features:** Victim race, gender, incident type, reporting area, weapon use, time of occurrence, etc.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

### Objective
To investigate and model the factors influencing why certain cases are marked as "Suspended" using classification techniques such as Decision Trees and Random Forest.

### Key Findings
- **Accuracy:** 92%
- **Precision (Suspended):** 93%
- **Recall (Suspended):** 99%
- **Top Predictors:**
  - Incident Type (e.g., Natural/Accidental Death)
  - Reporting Area
  - Victim Race (less influential but present)

## ðŸ›  Tools & Techniques
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Models:** Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier
- **EDA:** Gender distribution, weapon types, temporal trends
- **Preprocessing:** Encoding categorical variables, handling missing data, scaling

## ðŸ§  Insights
- Operational and geographic factors like incident type and reporting area strongly influence case suspensions.
- Demographic variables like race are less dominant but still significant, pointing to possible systemic disparities.
- The model struggled to recall non-suspended cases due to class imbalance.
```

## ðŸš€ Future Work
- Address class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE or class weighting.
- Incorporate temporal patterns more explicitly.
- Explore fairness-aware ML techniques to mitigate bias.
